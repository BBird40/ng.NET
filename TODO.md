To-do
==========
A list of todo's for the project

* Bug: When the application is refreshed after routing from client-side throws 404 error.
* Bug: Update form will not appear.
* Bug: localhost settings are tied to common.services.
* Bug: bootstrap not tied to form.

* Refactor: Update MVC version to replicate Web API version.
* New Feature: Possibly create one last project to represent mapping the domain objects to the database entities and vice versa?

Architecture in question
-------------------

* Should there be a separate folder for holding common javascript utilities? These scripts are similar to resources, why not app/js/resources.
